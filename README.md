# Python_Projects

A collection of little projects I have completed in Python to challenge myself, create something, and increase my skills in Python.

List w/ short description:
IP_Calculator; an IP calculator that takes an IP and Subnet Mask and returns the important address (network, first, last, broadcast). 
I was happy with how the input validation turned out on this and I think I was able to nail down all addresses. There are some improvements that could be made,
mainly algorithmically taking care of the 255.255.255.255 masks and I feel it got a bit brute forceish at the end and there may be better ways to approach it.
A V2 may be worked on in the future.
